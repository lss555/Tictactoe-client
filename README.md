Tic Tac Toe README

A javascript, html, CSS, API ran Tictactoe application

Game API docs ('https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api')

This application plays games of Tictactoe via a game api with token authentication
for users accounts, as well as, sign up, sign in, changepassword and sign out.

Signed in users can start new games, play games, view if game was won, lost,
or tied, aswell as being able to view games played.

For a plan I wrote a wire frame (imgur link: https://imgur.com/eGGgSyb) and a plan (imgur link: https://imgur.com/r0tcmYK) with each file and went through all of
the forms and user stories.  To start I just made all the forms, and CSS board.  I
had to think about how winning would work for a while but realized I would just have to
do a bunch of if statments.  So I wrote down the winning possibilites and put them in array's.

Through out the project I never had to much of strategy other then to work on completing
one peice and then another until I get it finished

unsolved problems, how to make a guest mode, and giving ranks to players who have given games played.
